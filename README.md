# Nug

Nug is a minimal reactive DOM system, based on svelte 4. It does not use DOM diffing or proxies, because magic sucks. This project was inspired by the pain of migrating my applications to svelte 5.

This is alpha software, don't use it unless you're willing to read the code (there isn't very much of it).

# Example

To see the demo, clone the repository and run `npm i && npm run dev` or visit [https://nug-n8tt.onmount.com/](https://nug-n8tt.onmount.com/). The code that is running can be found in [src/example.ts](src/example.ts).
